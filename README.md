# Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It automates tasks like deploying, scaling, and maintaining applications, ensuring they run efficiently and reliably.

Key Features of Kubernetes:
Scalability: Automatically adjusts resources based on demand.

Resilience: Restarts or replaces containers if they fail.

Portability: Runs consistently across cloud platforms and on-premises.

Load Balancing: Distributes traffic evenly for better performance.

Advanced Deployment: Enables smooth rollouts with minimal downtime.

Kubernetes is ideal for managing modern applications that require flexibility, reliability, and efficiency at scale.
